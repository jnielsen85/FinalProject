# Gatsby-JNS Surfboards
A [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) powered site for JNS Surfboards.  A local shaper of custom boards from the Gold Coast QLD.  

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.   [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/en-au/payments/checkout) is used to faciliate payment collection through the site.  Currently JNS Surfboards utitlizes the client-only integration, whereby products are defined directly in the stripe dashboard and referenced by ID on the client side. This allows easy integration of checkout into the site WITHOUT any server-side code.

#Using gatsby
A steep learning curve initially, but worth the investment in the end.

### Develop
Runs a server in the background, enabling useful features like hot-reloading development environment (served on `localhost:8000`) and Gatsby’s data explorer [GraphiQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/running-queries-with-graphiql/).
```shell
gatsby develop
```

### Build
Creates a version of your site with production-ready optimizations like packaging up your site’s config, data, and code, and creating all the static HTML pages that eventually get rehydrated into a React application into a 'Public' folder.  
```shell
gatsby build
```

### Serve
Starts a local HTML server for testing your built site.
```shell
gatsby serve
```


## Deployment

### Option 1: Deployment without connecting to Git.
After Running
```shell
gatsby build
```
Deployment without connecting to Gitto netlify by is as simple as Dragging and Dropping the public folder into Netlify's deployment dashboard.

### Option 2: New Site from Git

You can connect to a repo or even have netlify create a new repo in your Git Hub account. From there just push your changes to GitHub and Netlify will automatically deploy them to their global CDN.

## CMS
Netlify CMS Utilised in the site build.  Simplifies site updating. Identity and Authentication must be set up [How To Set Up Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/).  Actually utilising this is on TO DO List.  

## Dependancies

A lot of dependancies used in the original starter code.  33 in fact.  Some notable mentions that i got hands on with:

* [Gatsby Link API](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/): enables linking to internal pages as well as a powerful performance feature called preloading
* [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview): Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts: Getting values in and out of form state, Validation and error messages, Handling form submission
* [Gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms/): Netlify CMS is a React single page app for editing git based content via API. Its built for non-technical and technical editors alike.  STILL learning to utilise.
* [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup): A JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.  Easy to use and time saving.
* [gatsby-plugin-elasticlunr-search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gatsby-contrib/gatsby-plugin-elasticlunr-search):  This plugin enables search integration via elastic lunr. Content is indexed and then made available via graphql.  Used to allow search features for for things like page title and page. NOTE:  Havent got my search full working.
